# Discord Bot Project

üöÄ I am programming my Discord bot as it fills me with joy and passion for programming, and I aim to improve my skills in this field.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

This project consists of programming a Discord bot. The files provided here may not always function flawlessly due to occasional errors. Nevertheless, I make them publicly available, but I recommend using them with caution.

If you'd like to join my Discord server and collaborate with each other, here's the link: [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NfUPSMucMd).

Also, as you may have noticed, this bot is customized and based on the template provided by [TFAGaming](https://github.com/TFAGaming/DiscordJS-V14-Bot-Template). So, all credit goes to this awesome individual for providing us with this code.
